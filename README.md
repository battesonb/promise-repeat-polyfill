# Promise Repeat Polyfill

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/battesonb/promise-repeat-polyfill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/battesonb/promise-repeat-polyfill)

Lightweight Promise polyfill for a sequential repeat method.

I know this is not a true polyfill, but this is a method I would love to see added to the default Promise implementation.

## Node.js
`npm install promise-repeat-polyfill`

## Testing
* `npm install` to install testing framework
* `npm test` to run tests
